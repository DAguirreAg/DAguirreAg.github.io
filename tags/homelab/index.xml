      <description>As a data engineer, it is quite obvious that I like tinkering with technology, specially with software related stuff. Because of this, some time ago I decided to setup my own simple homelab where I could experiment and run scripts around without worrying about setting up cloud services.
As such, I have decided to share how I setted up my homelab, so others can use it as an inspiration or just have a look at it.</description>
