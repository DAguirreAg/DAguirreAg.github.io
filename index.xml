      <description>With the homelab hardware set up, it is time to start preparing the machines so they can work together. As I intend to use my homelab as a safe and easy to use &amp;ldquo;IT playground&amp;rdquo;, I have decided that the following elements would need to be setup:
Static IP address on each machine. This facilitates troubleshooting as well as easing the communication between the machines. Remote control software and SSH. This facilitates troubleshooting my &amp;ldquo;remote&amp;rdquo; machines without having to hook a keyboard+mouse+monitor to them.</description>

      <description>As a data engineer, it is quite obvious that I like tinkering with technology, specially with software related stuff. Because of this, some time ago I decided to setup my own simple homelab where I could experiment and run scripts around without worrying about setting up cloud services.
As such, I have decided to share how I set up my homelab, so others can use it as an inspiration or just have a look at it.</description>
