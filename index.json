[{"content":"As a data engineer, it is quite obvious that I like tinkering with technology, specially with software related stuff. Because of this, some time ago I decided to setup my own simple homelab where I could experiment and run scripts around without worrying about setting up cloud services.\nAs such, I have decided to share how I setted up my homelab, so others can use it as an inspiration or just have a look at it.\n1. Requirements No project can start without the prior requirement gathering. Next I am displaying the main points I want to get in my homelab:\nHardware-wise Low power consumption (as I plan to have projects running 24/7). Low noise (as I will place it near my living room). Low cost setup. Software-wise Monitor network activity. Run projects 24/7. 2. Hardware Based on the requirements and a little bit of research (and availability of the devices), I settled down for the following:\nRaspberry Pi 4 Model B (8Gb ram) Raspberry Pi 3 Model B + TP Link TL-WR940N (Router) Main Desktop PC Seagate Expansion Portable Hard Drive SRD0NF1 (external HDD) Homelab hardware. 3. Network architecture/topology The devices communicate with each other via ethernet connection, all of them connected through a centralized router. Note that even though the router is a single Point-Of-Failure, it is very unlikely to happen, and none of the services I am running are critical enough to consider for a redundant solution. Find below the topology of my homelab:\nOverview of Network topology. Future steps Ideally, I would like to have another Raspberry Pi 4 fully dedicated to experimentation. This should allow me to identify issues that may arise when deploying services in my 24/7 running Raspberry Pi 4, without risking breaking it.\n","permalink":"https://daguirreag.github.io/posts/setting-up-my-own-home-lab-hardware-networking/","summary":"As a data engineer, it is quite obvious that I like tinkering with technology, specially with software related stuff.
