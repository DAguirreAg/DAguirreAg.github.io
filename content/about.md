Hi and welcome to my personal blog, my name is Daniel! 

I am a Data Engineer who lives and works in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. However, previously I worked as a production engineer in China for 4 years, before spending some time as a robotics engineer in Spain.

My expertise lies in the realms of data engineering, software engineering, and project management, where I drive end-to-end projects aligned with business needs.

If you want to connect with me or just discuss anything, just drop me a message on any of my other Social Media platforms (links below).
